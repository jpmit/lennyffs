# This directory contains 'utilities' (mainly python scripts) that are
# useful for using with .xyz configuration files, i.e. files generated
# after running Monte-Carlo / Molecular dynamics simulations.
# A brief description where necessary is given below, further 
# documentation is in the comments in the scripts themselves.

# These are the only two utilities that are not python scripts (they
# were originally written in C++, so documentation is not available
# in the files themselves (unless you can read binaries).
