INTRODUCTION
------------

lennyffs is a code for FFS simulations of LJ systems.  
It was designed to investigate crystal nucleation of LJ systems
on surfaces.

It can also be used to do 'conventional' Metropolis Monte-Carlo style
simulations of LJ fluids / solids.  It will do either NVT or NPT.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Python 2.x
Numpy
Boost C++ libraries
C++ compiler
Fortran compiler

INSTALLATION
------------

Navigate to ./modules/fortran and run 'make' to compile fortran library
Add path to ./modules/python and ./modules/fortran to your PYTHONPATH 
environment variable

RUNNING CODE
-------------

The following scripts are in the exec directory:
code.py - for normal NVT/NPT Monte-Carlo
codeffs.py - for FFS simulation with NVT/NPT Monte-Carlo dynamics
diagnostics.py - run after codeffs to collect FFS results
