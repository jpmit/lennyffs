* Refactor C++ source file modules/cpp/ops/pyfunctions.cpp ; currently
  a lot of code is being repeated.  However, any refactoring must
  preserve speed to some extent, since many of these functions are
  called every MC cycle (actually usually every 10 or so).

* Get visfunc.py to work with new 'list' parameters

* Add module to make histograms/free energy plots

* hist.py still produces lots of blank lines - need to work out why
