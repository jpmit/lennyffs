# Example in file for ONE WINDOW umbrella simulation - To be run with umbrella.py
#
# To run this example, copy this file into an empty directory and run
# the main Python script [base]/umbrella.py (or you can just keep the
# input file in this directory, but it is probably best to keep it
# outwith any git repository).

# simulation can be either new or restart
simulation new
# since new above, restartfile is ignored
restartfile equil.xyz

# interaction potential can be either 'gauss' or 'len'
potential gauss
# cutoff radius for interaction
